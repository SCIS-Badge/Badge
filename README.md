## What Can We Learn from Quality Assurance Badges in Open-Source Software?

Welcome to the homepage of our SCIS submission "What Can We Learn from Quality Assurance Badges in Open-Source Software?"

#### Part 1

The complete project lists we collected from GitHub are shown in the "Projects" folder, where the projects are grouped by programming languages, and ordered by the number of stars.

#### Part 2

For each projects, we show the README file and README file after converting to HTML format using Pandoc in the "READMEs" folder. Considering the large quantity of files, we give a compressed file for each programming language.

#### Part 3

The identified images (potentially badges) are in the "Badges" folder.

#### Part 4

The classification results of each badge are in "badge_classification_results.xlsx"

#### Part 5

The results of badge frequency (in each programming language) are in the "Badge_frequency" folder.

#### Part 6

The results of badge combination frequency (in each programming language) are in the "Badge_combination_frequency" folder.

#### Part 7

The results of statistical analysis is in "Statistical_analysis.pdf".
